# Bluevery VSCode Theme 
A bluevery theme in VSCode created using the [vsctb npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vsctb). This color palette was modified from a template provided by vsctb.

Listen up, this theme was inspired by a little guy that lives in a blue world. All dark and all light everything he sees is just blue. Like him, inside and outside. Blue his workbench with a blue little window. And a blue terminal, and everything is blue for him. And him. And everybody around. 'Cause he aint got nobody to listen.
